# Field Safety 

### After eight years as a field technician, field safety has become a passion of mine. 
Field research is inherently dangerous, but we can be safe and prepared if we follow proper planning and value field safety in the workplace. As a graduate student, I have made it a priority of mine to improve the field safety resources and culture in my department. 

As a graduate student representative on the *ESPM Field Safety Committee*, I have

- created three graduate student field safety workshops (General UCB Safety, Crew Management, and Identity Based Field Safety) 
- offered the General UCB Safety workshop for graduate students 
- attended the inaugural UC Field Safety Conference and the UC Queer/Trans Student Field Safety Conference 

Our team as a whole 

- organized and advertised Spring 2024 Sexual Assault Prevention in the Field half day training
- created an ESPM specific Field Safety Plan Template 
- surveyed nearly 500 students and researchers on the safety of their field experiences at UC Berkeley
- collected and redacted example field safety plans for reference 
- drafted a list of recommendations for the department to improve field safety in the future
